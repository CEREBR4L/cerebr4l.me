Clone the repo and enter it and install dependences...
```

```

Once you have done this your default browser should pop up with a simple Corn landing page. 

You can not get into the code in the app folder and work on your projects without having to do the set up!

Using browserfiy and means your browser should reload and serve you the newest version of your code any time you save a file.
